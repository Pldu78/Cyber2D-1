If you are not familiar with git, I suggest you to install _TortoiseGit_ which is a convenient software to use. In the next steps, I will use this software to show you how to save and send your updates of the project.

#### _Visual Studio Code_
https://code.visualstudio.com/download

#### _npm_
Download and install nodejs 
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

To double-check that npm has installed. Write _npm_ in a console. It should display something like below.

## The game
#### _Quick version_

- Clone the repository https://github.com/ddhaiby/Cyber2D
- Make sure you are up-to-date with master branch
- In a console of the root project run the following line
  - npm i
  - npm run start
- The console should show you a link. It looks like _http://localhost:1234/_. In a browser write this localhost link to see the game 
- You are ready! You can now use Visual Studio code to make your change. When you save your changes, the browser page automatically refreshes so you can see and debug your work.

#### _Long version_

If you are not familiar with git, this version will help you understand the basis of git through TortoiseGit.

##### I) Check installation
First of all make sure TortoiseGit is correctly installed. The quickest way to check it is to right click on your file explorer and see if TortoiseGit is on the menu.

##### II) Clone the repo
On this menu, click on ''Git Clone''. You should see a menu like the image below. Make sure the _URL_ is https://github.com/ddhaiby/Cyber2D and choose the directory to download the repository. Press OK then.
