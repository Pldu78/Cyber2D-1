Under WebGL only the following Blend Modes are available:

* ADD
* MULTIPLY
* SCREEN
* ERASE

Canvas has more available depending on browser support.

You can also create your own custom Blend Modes in WebGL.

Blend modes have different effects under Canvas and WebGL, and from browser to browser, depending
on support. Blend Modes also cause a WebGL batch flush should it encounter a new blend mode. For these
reasons try to be careful about the construction of your Scene and the frequency of which blend modes
are used.

### scrollFactorX

â€¢ **scrollFactorX**: `number`

The horizontal scroll factor of this Game Object.

The scroll factor controls the influence of the movement of a Camera upon this Game Object.

When a camera scrolls it will change the location at which this Game Object is rendered on-screen.
It does not change the Game Objects actual position values.

A value of 1 means it will move exactly in sync with a camera.
A value of 0 means it will not move at all, even if the camera moves.
Other values control the degree to which the camera movement is mapped to this Game Object.

Please be aware that scroll factor values other than 1 are not taken in to consideration when
calculating physics collisions. Bodies always collide based on their world position, but changing
the scroll factor is a visual adjustment to where the textures are rendered, which can offset
them from physics bodies if not accounted for in your code.

### state

â€¢ **state**: `string` \| `number`

The current state of this Game Object.

Phaser itself will never modify this value, although plugins may do so.

Use this property to track the state of a Game Object during its lifetime. For example, it could change from
a state of 'moving', to 'attacking', to 'dead'. The state value should be an integer (ideally mapped to a constant
in your game code), or a string. These are recommended to keep it light and simple, with fast comparisons.
If you need to store complex data about your Game Object, look at using the Data Component instead.

### addToDisplayList

â–¸ **addToDisplayList**(`displayList?`): [`HealPickup`](Pickups_HealPickup.HealPickup.md)

Adds this Game Object to the given Display List.

If no Display List is specified, it will default to the Display List owned by the Scene to which
this Game Object belongs.

A Game Object can only exist on one Display List at any given time, but may move freely between them.

If this Game Object is already on another Display List when this method is called, it will first
be removed from it, before being added to the new list.

You can query which list it is on by looking at the `Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject#displayList` property.

If a Game Object isn't on any display list, it will not be rendered. If you just wish to temporarly
disable it from rendering, consider using the `setVisible` method, instead.

#### Parameters

### createBitmapMask

â–¸ **createBitmapMask**(`renderable?`): `BitmapMask`

Creates and returns a Bitmap Mask. This mask can be used by any Game Object,
including this one.

Note: Bitmap Masks only work on WebGL. Geometry Masks work on both WebGL and Canvas.

To create the mask you need to pass in a reference to a renderable Game Object.
A renderable Game Object is one that uses a texture to render with, such as an
Image, Sprite, Render Texture or BitmapText.

If you do not provide a renderable object, and this Game Object has a texture,
it will use itself as the object. This means you can call this method to create
a Bitmap Mask from any renderable Game Object.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `renderable?` | `GameObject` | A renderable Game Object that uses a texture, such as a Sprite. |

#### Returns

### createGeometryMask

â–¸ **createGeometryMask**(`graphics?`): `GeometryMask`

Creates and returns a Geometry Mask. This mask can be used by any Game Object,
including this one.

To create the mask you need to pass in a reference to a Graphics Game Object.

If you do not provide a graphics object, and this Game Object is an instance
of a Graphics object, then it will use itself to create the mask.

This means you can call this method to create a Geometry Mask from any Graphics Game Object.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `graphics?` | `Graphics` | A Graphics Game Object. The geometry within it will be used as the mask. |

#### Returns

`GeometryMask`

### destroy

â–¸ **destroy**(`fromScene?`): `void`

Destroys this Game Object removing it from the Display List and Update List and
severing all ties to parent resources.

Also removes itself from the Input Manager and Physics Manager if previously enabled.

Use this to remove a Game Object from your game if you don't ever plan to use it again.
As long as no reference to it exists within your own code it should become free for
garbage collection by the browser.

If you just want to temporarily disable an object then look at using the
Game Object Pool instead of destroying it, as destroyed objects cannot be resurrected.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `fromScene?` | `boolean` | `True` if this Game Object is being destroyed by the Scene, `false` if not. Default false. |

### disableInteractive

â–¸ **disableInteractive**(): [`HealPickup`](Pickups_HealPickup.HealPickup.md)

If this Game Object has previously been enabled for input, this will disable it.

An object that is disabled for input stops processing or being considered for
input events, but can be turned back on again at any time by simply calling
`setInteractive()` with no arguments provided.

If want to completely remove interaction from this Game Object then use `removeInteractive` instead.

### removeFromDisplayList

â–¸ **removeFromDisplayList**(): [`HealPickup`](Pickups_HealPickup.HealPickup.md)

Removes this Game Object from the Display List it is currently on.

A Game Object can only exist on one Display List at any given time, but may move freely removed
and added back at a later stage.

You can query which list it is on by looking at the `Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject#displayList` property.

If a Game Object isn't on any Display List, it will not be rendered. If you just wish to temporarly
disable it from rendering, consider using the `setVisible` method, instead.

___

### removeFromUpdateList

â–¸ **removeFromUpdateList**(): [`HealPickup`](Pickups_HealPickup.HealPickup.md)

Removes this Game Object from the Scene's Update List.

When a Game Object is on the Update List, it will have its `preUpdate` method called
every game frame. Calling this method will remove it from the list, preventing this.

Removing a Game Object from the Update List will stop most internal functions working.
For example, removing a Sprite from the Update List will prevent it from being able to
run animations.

___

### removeInteractive

â–¸ **removeInteractive**(): [`HealPickup`](Pickups_HealPickup.HealPickup.md)

If this Game Object has previously been enabled for input, this will queue it
for removal, causing it to no longer be interactive. The removal happens on
the next game step, it is not immediate.

The Interactive Object that was assigned to this Game Object will be destroyed,
removed from the Input Manager and cleared from this Game Object.

If you wish to re-enable this Game Object at a later date you will need to
re-create its InteractiveObject by calling `setInteractive` again.

If you wish to only temporarily stop an object from receiving input then use
`disableInteractive` instead, as that toggles the interactive state, where-as
this erases it completely.

If you wish to resize a hit area, don't remove and then set it as being
interactive. Instead, access the hitarea object directly and resize the shape
being used. I.e.: `sprite.input.hitArea.setSize(width, height)` (assuming the
shape is a Rectangle, which it is by default.)

Canvas has more available depending on browser support.

You can also create your own custom Blend Modes in WebGL.

Blend modes have different effects under Canvas and WebGL, and from browser to browser, depending
on support. Blend Modes also cause a WebGL batch flush should it encounter a new blend mode. For these
reasons try to be careful about the construction of your Scene and the frequency in which blend modes
are used.

___

### setCrop

â–¸ **setCrop**(`x?`, `y?`, `width?`, `height?`): [`HealPickup`](Pickups_HealPickup.HealPickup.md)

Applies a crop to a texture based Game Object, such as a Sprite or Image.

The crop is a rectangle that limits the area of the texture frame that is visible during rendering.

Cropping a Game Object does not change its size, dimensions, physics body or hit area, it just
changes what is shown when rendered.

The crop coordinates are relative to the texture frame, not the Game Object, meaning 0 x 0 is the top-left.

Therefore, if you had a Game Object that had an 800x600 sized texture, and you wanted to show only the left
half of it, you could call `setCrop(0, 0, 400, 600)`.

It is also scaled to match the Game Object scale automatically. Therefore a crop rect of 100x50 would crop
an area of 200x100 when applied to a Game Object that had a scale factor of 2.

You can either pass in numeric values directly, or you can provide a single Rectangle object as the first argument.

Call this method with no arguments at all to reset the crop, or toggle the property `isCropped` to `false`.

You should do this if the crop rectangle becomes the same size as the frame itself, as it will allow
the renderer to skip several internal calculations.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `x?` | `number` \| `Rectangle` | The x coordinate to start the crop from. Or a Phaser.Geom.Rectangle object, in which case the rest of the arguments are ignored. |
| `y?` | `number` | The y coordinate to start the crop from. |
| `width?` | `number` | The width of the crop rectangle in pixels. |
| `height?` | `number` | The height of the crop rectangle in pixels. |

#### Returns

___

### setDamping

â–¸ **setDamping**(`value`): [`HealPickup`](Pickups_HealPickup.HealPickup.md)

If this Body is using `drag` for deceleration this function controls how the drag is applied.
If set to `true` drag will use a damping effect rather than a linear approach. If you are
creating a game where the Body moves freely at any angle (i.e. like the way the ship moves in
the game Asteroids) then you will get a far smoother and more visually correct deceleration
by using damping, avoiding the axis-drift that is prone with linear deceleration.

If you enable this property then you should use far smaller `drag` values than with linear, as
they are used as a multiplier on the velocity. Values such as 0.95 will give a nice slow
deceleration, where-as smaller values, such as 0.5 will stop an object almost immediately.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `value` | `boolean` | `true` to use damping for deceleration, or `false` to use linear deceleration. |

#### Returns

___

### setData

â–¸ **setData**(`key`, `data?`): [`HealPickup`](Pickups_HealPickup.HealPickup.md)

Allows you to store a key value pair within this Game Objects Data Manager.

If the Game Object has not been enabled for data (via `setDataEnabled`) then it will be enabled
before setting the value.

If the key doesn't already exist in the Data Manager then it is created.

```javascript
sprite.setData('name', 'Red Gem Stone');
```

You can also pass in an object of key value pairs as the first argument:

```javascript
sprite.setData({ name: 'Red Gem Stone', level: 2, owner: 'Link', gold: 50 });
```

To get a value back again you can call `getData`:

```javascript
sprite.getData('gold');
```

Or you can access the value directly via the `values` property, where it works like any other variable:

```javascript
sprite.data.values.gold += 50;
```

When the value is first set, a `setdata` event is emitted from this Game Object.

If the key already exists, a `changedata` event is emitted instead, along an event named after the key.
For example, if you updated an existing key called `PlayerLives` then it would emit the event `changedata-PlayerLives`.
These events will be emitted regardless if you use this method to set the value, or the direct `values` setter.

Please note that the data keys are case-sensitive and must be valid JavaScript Object property strings.
This means the keys `gold` and `Gold` are treated as two unique values within the Data Manager.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `key` | `string` \| `object` | The key to set the value for. Or an object of key value pairs. If an object the `data` argument is ignored. |
| `data?` | `any` | The value to set for the given key. If an object is provided as the key this argument is ignored. |

### setDrag

â–¸ **setDrag**(`x`, `y?`): [`HealPickup`](Pickups_HealPickup.HealPickup.md)

Sets the body's horizontal and vertical drag. If the vertical drag value is not provided, the vertical drag is set to the same value as the horizontal drag.

Drag can be considered as a form of deceleration that will return the velocity of a body back to zero over time.
It is the absolute loss of velocity due to movement, in pixels per second squared.
The x and y components are applied separately.

### setInteractive

â–¸ **setInteractive**(`hitArea?`, `callback?`, `dropZone?`): [`HealPickup`](Pickups_HealPickup.HealPickup.md)

Pass this Game Object to the Input Manager to enable it for Input.

Input works by using hit areas, these are nearly always geometric shapes, such as rectangles or circles, that act as the hit area
for the Game Object. However, you can provide your own hit area shape and callback, should you wish to handle some more advanced
input detection.

If no arguments are provided it will try and create a rectangle hit area based on the texture frame the Game Object is using. If
this isn't a texture-bound object, such as a Graphics or BitmapText object, this will fail, and you'll need to provide a specific
shape for it to use.

You can also provide an Input Configuration Object as the only argument to this method.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `hitArea?` | `any` | Either an input configuration object, or a geometric shape that defines the hit area for the Game Object. If not given it will try to create a Rectangle based on the texture frame. |
| `callback?` | `HitAreaCallback` | The callback that determines if the pointer is within the Hit Area shape or not. If you provide a shape you must also provide a callback. |
| `dropZone?` | `boolean` | Should this Game Object be treated as a drop zone target? Default false. |

### setMask

â–¸ **setMask**(`mask`): [`HealPickup`](Pickups_HealPickup.HealPickup.md)

Sets the mask that this Game Object will use to render with.

The mask must have been previously created and can be either a GeometryMask or a BitmapMask.
Note: Bitmap Masks only work on WebGL. Geometry Masks work on both WebGL and Canvas.

If a mask is already set on this Game Object it will be immediately replaced.

Masks are positioned in global space and are not relative to the Game Object to which they
are applied. The reason for this is that multiple Game Objects can all share the same mask.

Masks have no impact on physics or input detection. They are purely a rendering component
that allows you to limit what is visible during the render pass.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `mask` | `BitmapMask` \| `GeometryMask` | The mask this Game Object will use when rendering. |

The scroll factor controls the influence of the movement of a Camera upon this Game Object.

When a camera scrolls it will change the location at which this Game Object is rendered on-screen.
It does not change the Game Objects actual position values.

A value of 1 means it will move exactly in sync with a camera.
A value of 0 means it will not move at all, even if the camera moves.
Other values control the degree to which the camera movement is mapped to this Game Object.

Please be aware that scroll factor values other than 1 are not taken in to consideration when
calculating physics collisions. Bodies always collide based on their world position, but changing
the scroll factor is a visual adjustment to where the textures are rendered, which can offset
them from physics bodies if not accounted for in your code.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `x` | `number` | The horizontal scroll factor of this Game Object. |
| `y?` | `number` | The vertical scroll factor of this Game Object. If not set it will use the `x` value. Default x. |

### setSize

â–¸ **setSize**(`width`, `height`): [`HealPickup`](Pickups_HealPickup.HealPickup.md)

Sets the internal size of this Game Object, as used for frame or physics body creation.

This will not change the size that the Game Object is rendered in-game.
For that you need to either set the scale of the Game Object (`setScale`) or call the
`setDisplaySize` method, which is the same thing as changing the scale but allows you
to do so by giving pixel values.

If you have enabled this Game Object for input, changing the size will _not_ change the
size of the hit area. To do this you should adjust the `input.hitArea` object directly.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `width` | `number` | The width of this Game Object. |
| `height` | `number` | The height of this Game Object. |

#### Returns

### setSizeToFrame

â–¸ **setSizeToFrame**(`frame`): [`HealPickup`](Pickups_HealPickup.HealPickup.md)

Sets the size of this Game Object to be that of the given Frame.

This will not change the size that the Game Object is rendered in-game.
For that you need to either set the scale of the Game Object (`setScale`) or call the
`setDisplaySize` method, which is the same thing as changing the scale but allows you

### setState

â–¸ **setState**(`value`): [`HealPickup`](Pickups_HealPickup.HealPickup.md)

Sets the current state of this Game Object.

Phaser itself will never modify the State of a Game Object, although plugins may do so.

For example, a Game Object could change from a state of 'moving', to 'attacking', to 'dead'.
The state value should typically be an integer (ideally mapped to a constant
in your game code), but could also be a string. It is recommended to keep it light and simple.
If you need to store complex data about your Game Object, look at using the Data Component instead.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `value` | `string` \| `number` | The state of the Game Object. |

#### Returns

[`HealPickup`](Pickups_HealPickup.HealPickup.md)

### setTexture

â–¸ **setTexture**(`key`, `frame?`): [`HealPickup`](Pickups_HealPickup.HealPickup.md)

Sets the texture and frame this Game Object will use to render with.

Textures are referenced by their string-based keys, as stored in the Texture Manager.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `key` | `string` | The key of the texture to be used, as stored in the Texture Manager. |
| `frame?` | `string` \| `number` | The name or index of the frame within the Texture. |

#### Returns

___

### setTint

â–¸ **setTint**(`topLeft?`, `topRight?`, `bottomLeft?`, `bottomRight?`): [`HealPickup`](Pickups_HealPickup.HealPickup.md)

Sets an additive tint on this Game Object.

The tint works by taking the pixel color values from the Game Objects texture, and then
multiplying it by the color value of the tint. You can provide either one color value,
in which case the whole Game Object will be tinted in that color. Or you can provide a color
per corner. The colors are blended together across the extent of the Game Object.

To modify the tint color once set, either call this method again with new values or use the
`tint` property to set all colors at once. Or, use the properties `tintTopLeft`, `tintTopRight,
`tintBottomLeft` and `tintBottomRight` to set the corner color values independently.

To remove a tint call `clearTint`.

To swap this from being an additive tint to a fill based tint set the property `tintFill` to `true`.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `topLeft?` | `number` | The tint being applied to the top-left of the Game Object. If no other values are given this value is applied evenly, tinting the whole Game Object. Default 0xffffff. |
| `topRight?` | `number` | The tint being applied to the top-right of the Game Object. |
| `bottomLeft?` | `number` | The tint being applied to the bottom-left of the Game Object. |
| `bottomRight?` | `number` | The tint being applied to the bottom-right of the Game Object. |

#### Returns

___

### setTintFill

â–¸ **setTintFill**(`topLeft?`, `topRight?`, `bottomLeft?`, `bottomRight?`): [`HealPickup`](Pickups_HealPickup.HealPickup.md)

Sets a fill-based tint on this Game Object.

Unlike an additive tint, a fill-tint literally replaces the pixel colors from the texture
with those in the tint. You can use this for effects such as making a player flash 'white'
if hit by something. You can provide either one color value, in which case the whole
Game Object will be rendered in that color. Or you can provide a color per corner. The colors
are blended together across the extent of the Game Object.

To modify the tint color once set, either call this method again with new values or use the
`tint` property to set all colors at once. Or, use the properties `tintTopLeft`, `tintTopRight,
`tintBottomLeft` and `tintBottomRight` to set the corner color values independently.

To remove a tint call `clearTint`.

To swap this from being a fill-tint to an additive tint set the property `tintFill` to `false`.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `topLeft?` | `number` | The tint being applied to the top-left of the Game Object. If not other values are given this value is applied evenly, tinting the whole Game Object. Default 0xffffff. |
| `topRight?` | `number` | The tint being applied to the top-right of the Game Object. |
| `bottomLeft?` | `number` | The tint being applied to the bottom-left of the Game Object. |
| `bottomRight?` | `number` | The tint being applied to the bottom-right of the Game Object. |
